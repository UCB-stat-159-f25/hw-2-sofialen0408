# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

## Description:
This repository creates the LIGO project as a reproducible research package, specifically focusing on the GW150914 event. There exists a ligotools package to run the functions in the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, an environment.yml file to install necessary dependencies, and a binder link below to open this repository in a separate Jupyter environment and run the notebook.
